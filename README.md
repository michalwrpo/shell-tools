# Shell-tools 

My recreations of Linux shell tools written in C. 

Due to this being mostly treated by me as a learning opportunity, some (most) implementations are less efficient than they could be, and sometimes overcomplicated (such as my version of tee using pipes).

Currently implemented:
- cat
- echo
- ls
- mkdir
- mkfifo
- tee
- touch
- yes
